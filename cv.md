## Summary

After years of working in the business area as a supply chain manager, I decided to change the career. I have always been passionate about computers and technology, so I chose to complete an online university program in computer science, while also acquiring new skills at RS School. My intention is to work as a full-stack web developer.

## Skills

  ages.sort((a, b) => a - b);

}
```
